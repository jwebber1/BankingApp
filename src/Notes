Some loans and cds aren't tied to existing customer ids (possibly other accounts).
If a class has a method that is supposed to affect a single object of that class, don't make it static, and don't force
passing in an instance of that class- Class.doSomething() works fine.
Use foreach if you can- it's more readable, and prevents off-by-one errors
Some date conversions aren't working ("can't parse this date with this simpledateformat" basically)
Some methods didn't work, didn't think of everything, or gave bugs- I fixed a few and left TODOs for some more
An arraylist has to be initialized (new Arraylist<>()) or it will give a null pointer
We only keep track of single lists of each type of object, so we don't need to pass arraylists into the export methods-
everything is saved
Don't remove something from a collection while you're looping through that collection in any way- do it before or later

Not a big deal, but try to make Intellij happy and set method, class, and variable accessibility to what it suggests
(so its real warnings and errors aren't as drowned out)

Test your code both ways...
